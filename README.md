# When Algorithm Meets Reality

## Temporal Side Channel Attack

This code demonstrates temporal side channel attack on the server at http://aoi.ise.bgu.ac.il/ as part of the class "Attacks on Implementations of Secure Systems" by Dr. Yossi Oren @BGU, spring 2021.

The server responds with '1' on correct password, '0' otherwise. The mission is to reveal the password by exploiting the temporal side channel intoduced by the sever. Every username is valid.

## How to Run?

```python3 ex01_M2.py [username]```

For example:
```python3 ex01_M2.py chendoy```
